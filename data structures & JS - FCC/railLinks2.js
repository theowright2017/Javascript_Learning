Imagine a limited rail network as follows:

A = Aberdeen, B = Belfast, C = Cardiff, E = Edinburgh, G = Glasgow, L = London

 - G <-> E
 - E <-> L
 - G <-> L
 - L <-> C
 - A <-> E
 - B has no links

You are working on a travel advice app.

Task 1 of 3: Write a function that which takes a start and end station, and returns a link (if one exists), or null / falsy.
